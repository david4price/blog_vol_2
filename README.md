# blog_vol_2

Practice using Flask framework as a side project mid course. 
My second try at creating a functional blog using Flask framework.
The project is almost done, needs just a few adjustments in order to deploy to heroku.

At the moment it's on hold as I moved to Django framework as part of my course.
